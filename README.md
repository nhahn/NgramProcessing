NgramProcessing
===============

This was the clustering application I built for my digital humanities class it:

* filters ngram data for a certain date and puts it in a SQL database
* clusters the ngrams using Pearson's product-moment 
* view the clusters, the centroid average, and the time series for the cluster members
